# cozygrad
A cozy little header-only autograd engine written from scratch in c++. Cozygrad evaluates directed acyclic graphs and computes their gradients. Graphs are constructed with a simple and easy to use API. 

# TODO
1. Implement more OPS: Sigmoid, LogSoftmax
2. Add neural network
3. Get simple MNIST working & training.
4. Make tensor class better - n dimensions, broadcasting etc
5. GPU support!
